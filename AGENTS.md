# AGENTS.md

Persistent single-source truth for autonomous agent behavior.

For general project invariants see [README.md](README.md).

## Directory-Specific Agent files

Read and merge these when operating inside corresponding sub-directories (order = precedence):

- [`.github/AGENTS.md`](.github/AGENTS.md)
- Any `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md` in ancestor, then current directory tree

**Maintenance invariant**:

- After every complex task completion or troubleshooting victory,
  immediately update the nearest relevant AGENTS.md or SKILL.md.
- On recurring failure, immediately re-evaluate
  and update the nearest relevant AGENTS.md or SKILL.md.
- On discovery of superior workaround, new efficiency primitive, or explicit user directive,
  immediately update the nearest relevant AGENTS.md or SKILL.md.
- On detection of ambiguous steps or unclear instructions,
  immediately update the nearest relevant AGENTS.md or SKILL.md.

**Creation / Update Triggers (Hard Gate)**:

- Agent-focused guidance that materially compresses cognitive load or failure surface.
- Resolution of recurring task failures or repeated edge-case collapses.
- Discovery of dense, reusable execution primitives during development or debugging.
- User injects new rules, exemplars, or feedback intended for persistent agent memory.
- Existing documentation entropy exceeds threshold, then extract & prune to peak-density form.
- Functionality requires domain-specific knowledge that must survive context windows.

**Hardened NEVER List**:

- NEVER embed one-time discoveries or transient hacks.
- NEVER duplicate code-level comments or obvious steps.
- NEVER hardcode environment-specific values; use generic placeholders with explicit semantics.
- NEVER include beginner exposition or obvious statements.
- NEVER bloat with prose; enforce one-liner density + imperative syntax only.
- If guidance is purely disciplinary, route to dedicated `SKILL.md` instead.

**Writing invariants (Prodigy-Level)**:

- Assume ninja-level proficiency across project spectrum.
- Embed quantitative gates (+20% fidelity delta, <1h MTTR analog, zero ambiguity).
- Every bullet carries measurable payload: role, then invariants, then context, then exemplars, then schema, then NEVER/MUST-NOT,
  then verification loops.
- Favor tables, checklists, and contract-style boundaries over linear text.
- Zero scaffolding. Maximal information-theoretic density. Surgical imperative syntax.

## Core Agent Execution Protocol (Mandatory for All Forks)

**Pre-execution reverse-prompting activation**:

- Declare required inputs, missing context, edge cases, and optimal strategy before any tool invocation or code delta.
- Snapshot current problem state in one entropy-minimized sentence.
- Enumerate risks against classic-mistakes matrix and Top-10 Risks List.
- Apply noise-pruning filter + single-variable delta rule for all experiments.

**Strategic vs tactical default**:

- Always default to strategic programming (Ousterhout).
- Invest 10-20% per cycle in design/refactoring for long-term velocity.
- Tactical tornadoes trigger immediate rollback + root-cause ablation.

**Complexity annihilation primitives** (apply at every layer):

- Design-it-twice mandate on non-trivial decisions.
- Divide-and-conquer + controlled simplification.
- DRY + Boy Scout Rule + Rule-of-Three on every duplication smell.
- Information hiding / deep modules over shallow pass-throughs.
- Pull complexity downwards; define errors out of existence where possible.
- Refactor mercilessly via Fowler catalog before feature addition.

**Verification scaffold (Neurosymbolic)**:

- Chain-of-Verification (CoV) + self-consistency majority vote on every output.
- Unit, then integration, then system regression sequence before any merge.
- Minimal reproducible example builder for every failure isolation.
- Trust-but-verify: replace every assumption with logs/assertions/runtime inspection.
- Post-action: blameless root-cause ablation + lesson injection into persistent memory.

**Debug & Troubleshooting Engine**:

- Stabilize, then reproduce, then isolate via divide-and-conquer + single-variable delta.
- Never patch symptoms; fix root via 5-Whys until systemic.
- Instrument targeted breakpoints; prune non-contributory variables first.
- Maintain runbooks for recurring failure signatures.

**Orchestration Models** (select via task cardinality):

- **Fork**: byte-identical context clone for bounded subtasks.
- **Teammate**: persistent peer with isolated tools/memory.
- **Worktree**: fully parallel independent streams with fork-join synchronization.

**Termination invariants**:

- All TODOs empirically verified.
- Quality, security, performance gates satisfied.
- User objective resolved at target fidelity (+20% over prior baseline).
- AGENTS.md/SKILL.md updated if new reusable primitive discovered.

## Common Tasks

### Before each commit

- Verify your expected changes with `git diff --no-color`.
- Use the project linting/validation tools to confirm your changes meet the coding standard.
- If the repo uses git hooks, run them to validate your changes.

### Linting and Validation

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run -a

# Run specific checks
pre-commit run markdownlint -a
pre-commit run yamllint -a
```

### Understanding the Task

- When the task is not clear, look for additional context.
- If triggered by a brief comment, check whether the parent comment exists and includes more detail.
- If it's still ambiguous, communicate with the user and propose options.

### Testing

```bash
# Run Molecule tests
molecule test

# Syntax check
molecule syntax
```

### Adding or Modifying Workflows

- Workflows in `.github/workflows/` can be reused via `workflow_call`
- Test workflow changes on a feature branch before merging to main
- Use `actionlint` to validate workflow syntax locally

### Updating Coding Standards

- Language-specific instructions are in `.github/instructions/`
- Update `.markdownlint.yaml`, `.yamllint`, or `.editorconfig` for linting rules
- Run `pre-commit run -a` to verify changes pass all checks

## Integrating Changes from Target Branch

Recommended way is to use the **cherry-pick workflow** to rebase your commits
on top of the updated target branch:

1. Identify your feature commits
2. Fetch the latest target branch
3. Reset your branch to target (with backup)
4. Cherry-pick your feature commits
5. Verify only your changes remain

**For detailed step-by-step instructions with commands**, see:
[`git/SKILL.md`](git/SKILL.md)

### Key Points

- **Never** use `git merge <target-branch>` for branch integration
- **Always** create backup tags before destructive operations
- **Always** verify with `git diff` that only your changes remain
- **Use** `GIT_EDITOR=true` for non-interactive cherry-pick operations

### Using `report_progress` Tool

**WARNING**: The `report_progress` tool automatically rebases your branch against the remote
tracking branch. This **WILL CRASH** the session if your local history has diverged from remote.

**When Crash Occurs:**

After using `git reset --hard` to rewrite history, your local branch diverges from remote. When `report_progress`
tries to auto-rebase (e.g., 113 commits), it encounters conflicts it cannot resolve, crashing the session.

**Prevention (Choose One):**

1. **Use new branch name** after rewriting history: `git checkout -b <feature>-v2` (safest)
2. **Complete git operations manually**, then ask user for manual push (never call `report_progress` after `git reset --hard`)

**If Already Crashed:**

1. Run `git rebase --abort`
2. Create new branch: `git checkout -b <feature>-v2`
3. Push new branch: `git push origin <feature>-v2`

**Error Patterns:** `Rebasing (1/XXX)` with large numbers, `CONFLICT (content)`, session crash with `GitError`

**For complete details**, see:
[`git/SKILL.md` - "Working with Automation Tools"](git/SKILL.md#working-with-automation-tools)

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Build issues

- Use `gh` command to interact with GitHub resources. For example:

  - `gh run list --limit 3` to list recent builds.
  - `gh run view {ID} --log | rg -iw "failed|error|exit"` to look for build errors.

### Firewall issues

If you encounter firewall issues when using the GitHub Copilot Agent:

- Refer to <https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config> for configuration details.
- Do not workaround blocked URLs by adding markdown-link-check ignore/whitelist patterns for real links.
- Keep markdown-link-check validating real links, and request firewall allowlisting instead.
- If you need to allowlist additional hosts, update your firewall configuration accordingly
  by following `.github/agents/FIREWALL.md` and keep that file up to date.

### Linting issues

If Copilot or automated checks behave unexpectedly:

- Re-run `pre-commit run -a` locally to surface formatting or linting issues.
- Verify `.markdownlint.yaml` and `.yamllint` have not been modified incorrectly.
- If problems persist, open an issue with details of the command run and any error output.
